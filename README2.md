# project44/Celonis integration (Version 1)

## Purpose
The purpose of this reference implementation is to show how one might intgrate project44 with Celonis by pushing information from Movement, the project44 High Velocity Platform, to Celonis Process Mining Platform. This reference implementation is written using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en). This solution uses data push from project44 to create a set of tables in Celonis that include shipment and shipment order information.
